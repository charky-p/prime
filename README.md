# Prime
This is a small challenge of finding the largest prime number possible in under a second of runtime.
The final file is src/lucasMersennePrime.c. I wrote more on my blog [here].

## Usage

To compile and run the program in `src`, use the following command:
```bash
$ gcc -o lucasMersennePrime lucasMersennePrime.c -I/mingw64/include -L/mingw64/lib -lgmp
$ ./lucasMersennePrime.exe
```
